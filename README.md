# Computer_Vision-Face_detection
### What is Computer Vision? ###
Humans have no problem identifying objects and the environment around them. However, it is not so easy for computers to identify and distinguish between the various models, visuals, images and objects in the environment. This is where computer vision comes in handy.
In the simplest terms, computer vision is the discipline in a broad field of Machine Learning that teaches machines to see. Its objective is to extract meaning from pixels.

### Face Detection using Webcam ###
Face Detection using Open Source Computer Vision Library in python(OpenCV), we will use OpenCV in the detection of our face using a webcam.
OpenCV is built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products. 

### OpenCV for Machine Learning ###
OpenCV is a bunch of stuff mainly dealing with processing images and videos on your computer. This is a standard library for Computer Vision for Python tasks.

In this repository we will design a simple project to detect face using python and openCV.
